# LaTeX macros for Literate Agda

This repository contains the macros that I use for writing papers in Literate Agda.

These macros have a different aim than `agda.sty`, which is to allow a `.lagda`
file to be used as part of a mathematical paper, typeset in LaTeX, but with the
mathematics typechecked by Agda. Even if all this is doing is helping reduce
typos, this is better than nothing!
